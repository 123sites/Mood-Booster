# Mood-Booster App
## Description 

We wanted to make a user-friendly app that could randomly generate something mood boosting and humorous for Nerds. This app is called "Mood-Booster". Right when you open the page, there's an annimated cat walking across the screen for fun and moodboosting colors painted across the background. In the opening you are faced with the option to either see a joke or see a meme. it randomly generates one or the other, depending on what you feel like seeing and you have the option to like or dislike it. the "like" will save your joke or meme to later view by clicking "Favorites". The "dislike" button will make sure you don't see that content again.

## Features

## Technology

We used [API Link](https://rapidapi.com/humorapi/api/humor-jokes-and-memes) to get the jokes and [API Link](https://programming-memes-images.p.rapidapi.com/v1/memes) to get the memes.  We used local storage to store the information in-regards to what the client liked or disliked.  If they liked it, they can click "Favorites" to see all of them aganin.  This makes this App an MVP, because can provide information in-regards to what clients like.
