# Mood-Booster App
## About 

We wanted to make a user-friendly app that could randomly generate something mood boosting and humorous for Nerds. This app is called "Mood Booster". Right when you open the page, there's an annimated cat walking across the screen for fun and mood boosting colors painted across the background. In the opening you are faced with the option to either see a joke or see a meme. it randomly generates one or the other, depending on what you feel like seeing and you have the option to like or dislike it. The "like" will save your joke or meme to later view by clicking onto "Favorites" that is displayed on the left side of the screen.

## Features

The client can view their favorites anytime by clicking onto "Favorites," in the upper-left of the screen. 

## Technology

We used Google Fonts to improve the look of the text.  In addition, we have a responsive and laptop GIF to show how the app performs.  The API's used were [API Link](https://rapidapi.com/humorapi/api/humor-jokes-and-memes) to get the jokes and [API Link](https://programming-memes-images.p.rapidapi.com/v1/memes) to get the memes.  We used local storage to store the information in-regards to what the client liked or disliked.  If they liked it, they can click "Favorites" to see all of them aganin.  This makes our app an MVP, because it can provide information in-regards to what the client likes.
