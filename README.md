# Mood-Booster App
## About 

We wanted to make a user-friendly app that could randomly generate something moodboosting and humorous for Nerds. This app is called "Mood-Booster". Right when you open the page, there's an annimated cat walking across the screen for fun and moodboosting colors painted across the background. In the opening you are faced with the option to either see a joke or see a meme. it randomly generates one or the other, depending on what you feel like seeing and you have the option to like or dislike. the "like" will save your joke or meme for later. The "dislike" button will make sure you don't see that content again.

## Technology

We used [API](https://rapidapi.com/humorapi/api/humor-jokes-and-memes) to get the jokes and [API](https://rapidapi.com/thedeltaaw-NUf4SqoNoc/api/reddit-meme/) to get the memes.  We used local storage to store the information in-regards to what the client liked or disliked.  If they liked it, they can see it another time. If they dislike it, they won't see it again.
